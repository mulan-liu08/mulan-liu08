## About me
I am a student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science, graduating May 2027; I received my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in May 2025. I am passionate about creation through coding: developing any technology that has a tangible impact on everyday people's lives, making life easier, more interesting, and even more fun. I am interested in HCI and UI/UX areas, but I am current expanding into fullstack development.
